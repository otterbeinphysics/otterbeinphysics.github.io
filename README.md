## Otterbein Physics Code

This is a place where Otterbein professors are keeping public code for use by students or educators.

Current projects:

- [Electric field lines](/fieldlines) - shows 2D electric field lines for an arbitrary charge configuration, changing as the user moves charges. Perfect for freshman algebra or calc-based physics lab introductions. 

- [EM wave animation](/em-wave-animation) - shows a simple linearly polarized EM wave
- [Polarization animation](/em-wave-animation/polarizer.html) - Shows a representation of light going through 2-3 polarizers.  
- [Circular and Linear Polarization Adder](/em-wave-animation/add-circ.html) - Two animated EM waves of different polarizations are added together: show how circular light is made of linear light and vice-versa

- [Simulation of scattered EM waves from atoms in an optical medium](/opticalMediaGl) - A plane wave incident from the left creates phase-delayed secondary scattered wavelets in the medium. Depending on the phase and strength of the secondary wavelets, the wave phase gets advanced or delayed.  (Limitation: scatterers only respond to the primary wave, so it just shifts the primary wave back. I'd like to make a version where you can see the wave slowing down as each layer responds to the last..)
